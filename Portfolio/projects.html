    <h2>Easy User Management and Backup Automation with Bash Scripting</h2>
    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p>Our project is all about making a little computer program, called a script, that can do tasks like managing users and keeping backups on a Linux computer. The main goal is to make it easy to handle user accounts and make sure that important files are always backed up safely. By using a simple computer language called "Bash scripting," we can make a program that saves time and makes life easier for computer users.
    <h3>Functional Requirements:</h3>
    <p>Adding, Deleting, and Changing Users: Our script should let us add new users, remove existing ones, and make changes to user accounts on the Linux computer. This helps people who manage the computer do their job more easily.

        Managing Groups: Along with users, our script should also help with making and handling groups of users. This helps organize things and control who can do what on the computer.
        
        Backing Up Files: Our script should be able to make copies of important folders and store them safely. This way, if something goes wrong, we can always get our important files back</p>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Non-Functional Requirements:</h3>
    <p>Speed: Our script should work fast and not waste time so that tasks get done quickly.

        Safety: It's important to make sure our script runs securely so that nobody can mess with important stuff on the computer without permission.
        
        Compatibility: Our script should work on different types of Linux computers without needing a lot of changes. This makes it easier for people to use it on different machines.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>Our little script makes managing users and keeping backups on a Linux computer easy. By using simple language and a bit of programming, we've made tasks that used to take a lot of time much simpler. This shows how technology can make life easier for everyone.</p>
